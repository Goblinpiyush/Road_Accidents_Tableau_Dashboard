# Road_Accidents_Tableau_Dashboard

🚦 Ever wondered what a year of road accidents can reveal beyond the numbers?
 While working on this Tableau dashboard, I dove deep into the data behind UK road accidents— not just to visualize it, but to tell the story it hides.

💡 What I discovered was more than just charts and graphs:
Despite a total of 1,44,419 accidents, fatalities dropped, yet the pain of every 2,855 lives lost is still too real.

🚗  Most fatalities happened on dry roads and during fine weather, challenging the common belief that poor weather is the main cause of severe accidents. It’s a reminder that good weather doesn’t always mean safe roads — driver behavior and road design matter more than we think.

🚲 Cyclist fatalities dropped by 50.97%, a silver lining among grim stats.

📉 Across the board, accident severity has shown a year-on-year decline, sparking hope that safety measures might be working.

🔍 Each filter told a different story — whether it was vehicle types, road surfaces, or weather conditions. What started as data exploration turned into a narrative of human behavior, infrastructure, and impact.

📊 This dashboard taught me not just how to use Tableau, but how to communicate insights effectively — to move beyond “what happened” into “why it matters.”
